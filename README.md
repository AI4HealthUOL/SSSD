# Diffusion-based Time Series Imputation and Forecasting with Structured State Space Models


This is the official repository for the paper [Diffusion-based Time Series Imputation and Forecasting with Structured State Space Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=hHiIbk7ApW&referrer=%5BTMLR%5D(%2Fgroup%3Fid%3DTMLR)) <ins>accepted by TMLR</ins> . In combination with (conditional) diffusion and state-space models, we put forward diverse algorithms, particualary, we propose the generative model $SSSD^{S4}$, which is suited to capture long-term dependencies and demonstrates ***state-of-the-art*** results in time series across diverse missing scenarios and datasets.
